# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you come across any security concern or vulnarability, please report the information via email to security@docuseal.co instead of opening a GitHub issue. We will promptly respond and will collaborate with you to validate the issue, and resolve it ASAP.

**We have a bug bounty program to reward security researchers.**

Out of scope vulnerabilities:

- CSRF
- DNSSEC, CAA, CSP headers
- DNS or email security related
- Rate Limiting

Note: We reserve the right to classify any reported vulnerability as out of scope for the bug bounty program.
