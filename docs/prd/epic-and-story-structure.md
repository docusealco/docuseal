# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with multiple user stories - This enhancement will be delivered as one cohesive epic because all stories serve the unified objective of enabling 3-portal cohort management. Stories build sequentially (Admin portal → Student portal → Sponsor portal → Analytics) and leverage shared infrastructure. Multiple epics were rejected due to integration gaps and coordination overhead.
