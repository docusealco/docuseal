# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**
   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:
   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:
   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:
   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:
   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:
   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Validate Next Story Task

## Purpose

To comprehensively validate a story draft before implementation begins, ensuring it is complete, accurate, and provides sufficient context for successful development. This task identifies issues and gaps that need to be addressed, preventing hallucinations and ensuring implementation readiness.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Inputs

- Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story validation."
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`
- Identify and load the following inputs:
  - **Story file**: The drafted story to validate (provided by user or discovered in `devStoryLocation`)
  - **Parent epic**: The epic containing this story's requirements
  - **Architecture documents**: Based on configuration (sharded or monolithic)
  - **Story template**: `bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.md` for completeness validation

### 1. Template Completeness Validation

- Load `bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.md` and extract all section headings from the template
- **Missing sections check**: Compare story sections against template sections to verify all required sections are present
- **Placeholder validation**: Ensure no template placeholders remain unfilled (e.g., `{{EpicNum}}`, `{{role}}`, `_TBD_`)
- **Agent section verification**: Confirm all sections from template exist for future agent use
- **Structure compliance**: Verify story follows template structure and formatting

### 2. File Structure and Source Tree Validation

- **File paths clarity**: Are new/existing files to be created/modified clearly specified?

- **Dependencies**: Are task dependencies clear and correct?
- **Granularity**: Are tasks appropriately sized and actionable?
- **Completeness**: Do tasks cover all requirements and acceptance criteria?
- **Blocking issues**: Are there any tasks that would block others?

### 8. Anti-Hallucination Verification

- **Source verification**: Every technical claim must be traceable to source documents
- **Architecture alignment**: Dev Notes content matches architecture specifications
- **No invented details**: Flag any technical decisions not supported by source documents
- **Reference accuracy**: Verify all source references are correct and accessible
- **Fact checking**: Cross-reference claims against epic and architecture documents

### 9. Dev Agent Implementation Readiness

- **Self-contained context**: Can the story be implemented without reading external docs?
- **Clear instructions**: Are implementation steps unambiguous?
- **Complete technical context**: Are all required technical details present in Dev Notes?
- **Missing information**: Identify any critical information gaps
- **Actionability**: Are all tasks actionable by a development agent?

### 10. Generate Validation Report

Provide a structured validation report including:

#### Template Compliance Issues

- Missing sections from story template
- Unfilled placeholders or template variables
- Structural formatting issues

#### Critical Issues (Must Fix - Story Blocked)

- Missing essential information for implementation
- Inaccurate or unverifiable technical claims
