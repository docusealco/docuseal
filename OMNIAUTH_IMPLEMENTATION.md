# DocuSeal Omniauth Implementation Guide

This document describes the complete implementation of omniauth/SSO functionality in DocuSeal, restoring the features that were previously gated behind paywall checks.

## Overview

We have successfully implemented comprehensive omniauth support with the following providers:
- **SAML 2.0** - For enterprise SSO integration
- **Google OAuth2** - For Google account authentication  
- **Microsoft Graph** - For Microsoft/Office 365 authentication

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Added `provider` and `uid` columns to the `users` table
- Created migration: `db/migrate/20250719104801_add_omniauth_to_users.rb`
- Added unique index on `[provider, uid]` combination

### 2. User Model Updates
- Added `:omniauthable` to Devise modules
- Configured omniauth providers: `%i[saml google_oauth2 microsoft_graph]`
- Implemented `User.from_omniauth(auth)` class method for handling authentication callbacks
- Added support for both single-tenant and multi-tenant account creation

### 3. Devise Configuration
- Updated `config/initializers/devise.rb` with omniauth provider configurations
- Added environment variable-based configuration for SAML
- Configured Google OAuth2 and Microsoft Graph providers
- Added proper attribute mapping for SAML assertions

### 4. Controllers
- Created `app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb`
- Handles callbacks for all three providers (SAML, Google, Microsoft)
- Includes proper error handling and session management
- Updated `app/controllers/sso_settings_controller.rb` with configuration management

### 5. Views and UI
- Replaced SSO paywall placeholder with functional SAML configuration form
- Updated login form to include all three authentication providers
- Added SSO settings interface for SAML configuration
- Removed `Docuseal.multitenant?` checks that were gating SSO features

### 6. Routes
- Updated routes to include omniauth callbacks
- Added update action to SSO settings controller
- Enabled SSO settings for all users (removed paywall restrictions)

### 7. Gemfile Dependencies
Added the following gems:
```ruby
gem 'omniauth'
gem 'omniauth-rails_csrf_protection'
gem 'omniauth-saml'
gem 'omniauth-google-oauth2'
gem 'omniauth-microsoft_graph'
```

### 8. Development Environment
- Created `Dockerfile.dev` for development with mounted codebase
- Created `docker-compose.dev.yml` for local development environment
- Configured development environment with PostgreSQL and Redis

## Configuration

### SAML Configuration

#### Environment Variables
Set these environment variables for SAML configuration:
```bash
SAML_IDP_SSO_SERVICE_URL=https://your-idp.com/sso/saml
SAML_IDP_CERT_FINGERPRINT=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:AA:BB:CC:DD
SAML_SP_ENTITY_ID=docuseal
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### Database Configuration
Alternatively, configure SAML through the web interface at `/settings/sso` which stores encrypted configuration in the database.

#### Service Provider URLs
Provide these URLs to your Identity Provider:
- **Assertion Consumer Service URL**: `http://localhost:3000/users/auth/saml/callback`
- **SP Metadata URL**: `http://localhost:3000/users/auth/saml/metadata`
- **SP Entity ID**: `docuseal` (or your custom value)

### Google OAuth2 Configuration

Add to Rails credentials or environment variables:
```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

### Microsoft Graph Configuration

Add to Rails credentials or environment variables:
```bash
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your-microsoft-client-id
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=your-microsoft-client-secret
```

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Choose from available authentication methods:
   - Sign in with Google
   - Sign in with Microsoft
   - Sign in with SAML SSO (if configured)
3. Complete authentication with your chosen provider
4. You'll be automatically signed in or prompted to complete registration

### For Administrators
1. Go to Settings â†’ SSO
2. Configure SAML settings with your Identity Provider details
3. Test the configuration using the "Test SAML Login" button
4. Users can now authenticate using the configured SSO provider

## Development Setup

### Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Build the development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build

# Start the development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Access the application at http://localhost:3000
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install
yarn install

# Run database migrations
rails db:create db:migrate

# Start the development server
rails server
```

## Testing

### SAML Testing
1. Set up environment variables for SAML configuration
2. Navigate to `/settings/sso` to configure SAML
3. Use the "Test SAML Login" button to verify configuration
4. Check logs for any authentication errors

### OAuth Testing
1. Configure Google/Microsoft credentials
2. Navigate to login page
3. Click "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Microsoft"
4. Complete OAuth flow and verify user creation/authentication

## Security Considerations

1. **CSRF Protection**: Implemented via `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection` gem
2. **Secure Credentials**: Store sensitive configuration in Rails credentials or environment variables
3. **Certificate Validation**: SAML certificate fingerprints are validated
4. **Session Management**: Proper session cleanup and management implemented

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"NameError: uninitialized constant EncryptedConfig"**
   - This was resolved by moving SAML configuration to environment variables
   - Ensure proper initialization order in Devise configuration

2. **"Invalid credentials" errors**
   - Verify OAuth client IDs and secrets are correct
   - Check redirect URIs match exactly

3. **SAML authentication failures**
   - Verify IdP certificate fingerprint is correct
   - Check that assertion consumer service URL matches
   - Ensure name identifier format matches IdP configuration

### Logs
Check application logs for detailed error messages:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs app
```
